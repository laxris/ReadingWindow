Reading Window
==============

This small tool is intended to help readers with dyslexia and scotopic sensitivity syndrome (also known as Asfedia and Irlen Syndrome).

It fixes a small window with a slit to your mouse cursor, acting as a virtual cursor. 

It reportedly helps with keeping focused on the current line and prevents busy patterns and stripes, river effects and rising, falling, shaking or swirling lines phenomenons.

The program is free to use. Send a small donation to chrham (AT) gmx (DOT) net via paypal if it helps you. I'll be happy about any contribution towards another coffee, beer or book :)
